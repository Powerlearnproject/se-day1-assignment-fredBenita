#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is the process of applying engineering principles to design,develope,test and maintain softwares system which were created for reliability and efficiency
the importance of software engineering in the technology industry includes effecient problem solving;This means that developed software solves complex real life problem,making technology accessible and useful.(2)scaliability and reliaibility:it ensures that softwares system can handle growth and perform reliably under various condition.(3)cost and time efficiency:software engineering reduces developement time and cost leading to faster innovation and higher quality products in the tech industry.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
(1)structured programming(1960s-1970s);organised code into smaller,manageable modules
(2)Object oriented programming(1980s);Enabled resueable,scalable code through objects.
(3) Agile and devops(2000s-present)Streamedline developement with iterative progress and continous delivery.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
(1)Requirement gathering:This is the phase of defining software purpose,features and user needs
(2)Design:create a detailted design of system
(3)Implementation:Writing the actual code based on design
(4)Testing:identify and fix bugs to ensure software works correctly
(5)Deployment:Realease the software to users
(6)Maintainance:update and improve the software overtime based on feedback and changing needs


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
WATERFALL:liner and rigid;best for fixed requirement project.Eg (payroll system)
AGILE:iterative and flexible;suited for evolving project.E.g(Mobile app)
conclusion;Waterfall is sequential while Agile methodology allows on-going change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer:codes and builds software
Quality assurance engineer:Tests and ensures software quality
Project manager: Manages project timeline and resources

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs:provides tools like code editors,debuggers,and compilers in platforms,streamlining developement(E.g visual studio,pycharm)
VCS:Tracks changes,manages code version and enable collaboraton(E.g  GIT, subversion)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
(1)Managing changing requirement : with the use of agile methods to adapt to evolving needs through iterative developement and regular feedback
(2)Ensuring software quality : implementing rigorous testing process and continous integration to detect and fix issues early

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

prompt engineering is the process of giving well designed and refined input instruction to Ai models to elicit desired response.This is important because a well crafted prompt,improves the relevance and accuracy of AI generated output
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt : Tell me about technology
Improved prompt : Explain how blockchain technology works and its main application in finance
Explanation : The improved prompt is effective because it specifies the topic 9block chain technology) how it works,its context, which leads to a more targeted and relevant response
